### Hi there! 😁

My name is Gustavo de Paula from Brazil (🇧🇷). I've been working as Front-End Developer since 2007 and currently I'm Front-End Developer at [Certisign](https://certisign.com.br/). I've created some projects as [RedeEPI](https://www.redeepi.ong.br/) and I've always loved to produce a lot of content during my career.

In my free time I like to fight brazilian jiu-jitsu (🥋), to watch movies (🎞️) and TV Series (📺).

Would you like to find me?
